"A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. *Specialization is for insects*.

-Robert A. Heinlein"

This is a page dedicated to showcasing my projects, both personal and for work. I love all things AI and Data Science, hence why I'm pursuing a Master's in this field. I'd love to show you what I've produced, so hang around and click on stuff!
